# My Raylib Learning Repo

This repo holds very small projects in raylib that I have
written in order to learn how to use it. These projects are very small and
simple.

Right now the projects here are:
- A simple pong clone written in c
- A starfield for playing with raylib's 3d renderer in c++
- A test for using EnTT with raylib, also in c++
